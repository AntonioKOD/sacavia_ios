# iOS Profile Feed Viewer Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a full-screen, Instagram-style profile feed viewer for iOS, similar to the web implementation. The viewer allows users to browse through a user's posts in a full-screen modal with smooth navigation and video playback.

## Components

### 1. ProfileFeedViewer.swift

The main viewer component that provides:
- Full-screen modal presentation
- TabView-based navigation between posts
- Swipe gesture support for navigation
- Video autoplay and controls
- Infinite scroll loading
- Error handling and loading states

#### Key Features:
- **Full-screen overlay** with black background
- **Navigation controls** (arrow buttons and swipe gestures)
- **Video playback** with autoplay, mute/unmute, and play/pause controls
- **Infinite scroll** that loads more posts as needed
- **Post counter** showing current position
- **Close button** to return to the grid

### 2. ProfileView.swift Updates

Updated the `NormalizedProfileGridView` to integrate with the new viewer:
- Added state variables for viewer presentation
- Modified grid tile tap gestures to open the viewer
- Replaced the old `UserPostsFeedView` with the new `ProfileFeedViewer`

### 3. ProfileFeedViewerTestView.swift

A test view for verifying the viewer functionality:
- Creates mock data for testing
- Provides a simple interface to test the viewer
- Includes feature documentation and test instructions

## User Interactions

### Navigation
- **Swipe left/right**: Navigate between posts
- **Arrow buttons**: Precise navigation control
- **TabView**: Built-in page-based navigation

### Video Controls
- **Tap video**: Show/hide video controls
- **Play/pause button**: Control video playback
- **Mute/unmute button**: Toggle audio
- **Autoplay**: Videos start playing when they come into view
- **Auto-pause**: Videos pause when navigating away

### General
- **Close button**: Return to the profile grid
- **Post counter**: Shows current position (e.g., "3 of 15+")
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during data loading
- **Error handling**: Retry options for failed requests

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```swift
@State private var items: [NormalizedProfileFeedItem] = []
@State private var cursor: String?
@State private var activeIndex: Int = 0
@State private var isLoading = false
@State private var error: String?
@State private var hasMore = true
```

### Video Player
- Uses `AVPlayer` and `VideoPlayer` for video playback
- Implements autoplay with mute by default
- Handles video looping and end-of-playback events
- Provides custom controls overlay

### Data Loading
- Integrates with the existing `APIService.getNormalizedProfileFeed`
- Implements cursor-based pagination
- Loads more posts when approaching the end of the current list
- Handles loading states and error conditions

### Navigation
- Uses `TabView` with `PageTabViewStyle` for smooth page transitions
- Implements custom swipe gestures for additional navigation control
- Provides arrow buttons for precise navigation
- Handles edge cases (first/last post, loading more)

## Integration with Existing Code

### ProfileView Integration
The viewer integrates seamlessly with the existing profile grid:

```swift
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showingFeedViewer) {
    if let username = username, let postId = selectedPostId {
        ProfileFeedViewer(
            username: username,
            initialItems: feedItems,
            initialCursor: viewModel.nextCursor,
            isOpen: showingFeedViewer,
            onClose: {
                showingFeedViewer = false
                selectedPostId = nil
            },
            initialPostId: postId
        )
    }
}
```

### Data Models
Uses the existing `NormalizedProfileFeedItem` and related models:
- `NormalizedCover` for post covers
- `NormalizedMediaItem` for media details
- Maintains compatibility with the existing API structure

## Testing

### Test View
The `ProfileFeedViewerTestView` provides:
- Mock data generation
- Feature testing interface
- Documentation of expected behaviors
- Visual feedback for testing results

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Navigation**: Swipe and arrow button navigation
2. **Video Playback**: Autoplay, controls, and mute functionality
3. **Infinite Scroll**: Loading more posts when reaching the end
4. **Error Handling**: Network errors and retry functionality
5. **Edge Cases**: Empty states, single post, no media

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Videos are paused when not in view to save resources
- Player instances are properly cleaned up
- Images are loaded asynchronously with `AsyncImage`

### Network Efficiency
- Cursor-based pagination reduces unnecessary requests
- Only loads more data when needed
- Caches loaded posts in memory

### UI Responsiveness
- Smooth animations for navigation
- Loading states prevent UI blocking
- Gesture recognition with appropriate thresholds

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Gesture Recognition**: More sophisticated swipe gestures
2. **Video Preloading**: Preload adjacent videos for smoother playback
3. **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and accessibility labels
4. **Analytics**: Track user engagement with posts
5. **Sharing**: Add share functionality for individual posts
6. **Comments**: Integrate comment viewing within the viewer
7. **Likes**: Add like/unlike functionality
8. **Bookmarking**: Save posts for later viewing

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching**: Implement local caching for better performance
2. **Background Loading**: Load posts in the background
3. **Video Optimization**: Adaptive bitrate streaming
4. **Memory Optimization**: Better memory management for large feeds

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```swift
ProfileFeedViewer(
    username: "user123",
    initialItems: feedItems,
    initialCursor: nextCursor,
    isOpen: showingViewer,
    onClose: { showingViewer = false },
    initialPostId: selectedPostId
)
```

### Testing
1. Open the `ProfileFeedViewerTestView`
2. Tap "Load Test Data" to generate mock posts
3. Tap "Open Feed Viewer" to test the viewer
4. Test navigation, video playback, and other features

## Conclusion

The iOS Profile Feed Viewer provides a smooth, Instagram-like experience for browsing user posts. It integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing modern, intuitive interactions for users. The implementation is robust, performant, and ready for production use.
