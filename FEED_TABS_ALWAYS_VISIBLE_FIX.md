# 🎯 **FEED TABS ALWAYS VISIBLE - FIXED!**

## ✅ **Problem Solved**: Category Tabs Now Always Visible!

The issue where category tabs (People, Events, Places, etc.) were disappearing when clicking on specific tabs has been **completely resolved**!

---

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE & SOLUTION**

### **❌ Previous Problem:**
- **Issue**: When clicking on "People" tab, all other category tabs disappeared
- **Cause**: Filter tabs were only shown inside `FeedContent`, not in the main `LocalBuzzView`
- **Result**: Users lost navigation ability when switching between categories

### **✅ Solution Applied:**
- **Moved FilterTabs** from inside `FeedList` to the top level of `LocalBuzzView`
- **Always Visible**: Tabs now appear at the top of the feed regardless of selected filter
- **Consistent Navigation**: Users can always switch between categories

## 📱 **UI STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT**

### **✅ New Layout Structure:**
```
LocalBuzzView
├── FilterTabs (ALWAYS VISIBLE) ← NEW!
│   ├── All
│   ├── People  
│   ├── Events
│   ├── Places
│   └── etc.
└── Content Area
    ├── SimplePeopleSuggestionsView (when .people selected)
    └── FeedContent (for other filters)
```

### **✅ User Experience Benefits:**
- **Persistent Navigation**: Category tabs never disappear
- **Easy Switching**: Can switch between categories at any time

           .padding(.top, 8)
           .padding(.bottom, 8)
       
       // Content area below
       if feedManager.filter == .people {
           SimplePeopleSuggestionsView()
       } else {
           FeedContent(...)
       }
   }
   ```
