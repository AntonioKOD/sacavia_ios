# Blocking System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive blocking system implemented in the Sacavia app, similar to Instagram's functionality. The system allows users to block abusive users and prevents blocked users from seeing each other's content.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Blocking
- **Block User Functionality**: Users can block other users through multiple entry points
- **Block Reasons**: Users can specify reasons for blocking (harassment, inappropriate content, spam, fake account, other)
- **Block Confirmation**: Clear confirmation dialog explaining what happens when blocking someone

### 2. Content Filtering
- **Feed Filtering**: Blocked users' posts are automatically filtered out from the main feed
- **Search Filtering**: Blocked users are filtered out from search results
- **People Suggestions Filtering**: Blocked users are filtered out from people suggestions
- **Profile Filtering**: Blocked users' profiles are not accessible

### 3. Blocked Users Management
- **Blocked Users List**: Users can view all blocked users
- **Unblock Functionality**: Users can unblock users from the blocked users list
- **Block History**: Shows when users were blocked and the reason

### 4. Social Connection Management
- **Automatic Unfollowing**: When a user is blocked, both users are automatically unfollowed from each other
- **Follower Removal**: Blocked users are removed from each other's follower lists
- **Interaction Prevention**: Blocked users cannot like, comment, or interact with each other's content

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend API Integration
The blocking system uses the following API endpoints:
- `POST /api/mobile/users/block` - Block a user
- `DELETE /api/mobile/users/block` - Unblock a user
- `GET /api/mobile/users/blocked` - Get list of blocked users

### 2. Frontend Components

#### FeedManager.swift
- Added `blockedUserIds: Set<String>` property to track blocked users
- Added `loadBlockedUsers()` method to fetch blocked users from API
- Added `addBlockedUser()` and `removeBlockedUser()` methods
- Added `filterOutBlockedContent()` method to filter feed items
- Added `isUserBlocked()` method to check if a user is blocked

#### BlockUserView.swift
- Comprehensive blocking interface with reason selection
- Clear explanation of what happens when blocking someone
- Integration with FeedManager to update blocked users list
- Success/error handling with user feedback

#### BlockedUsersListView.swift
- List of all blocked users with unblock functionality
- Shows blocking reason and date

### 3. Data Flow

3. **User Blocking**: 
   - User selects block option
   - BlockUserView shows confirmation

   - Content is immediately filtered
   - Social connections are removed
4. **User Unblocking**:

   - FeedManager removes user from blocked list
   - Content filtering is updated

### 4. User Experience
